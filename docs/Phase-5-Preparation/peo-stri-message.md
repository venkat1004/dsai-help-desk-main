Good day,

Thank you for your patience as PEO-STRI regrouped once their furloughed employees have returned and have been getting back up to speed.

In our most recent conversation, we discussed the following for what could happen next if your company would agree to participate in this capacity:

PEO-STRI will gather sanitized sample data and provide it to CFIC for distribution to you (on or around 12 DEC)
Your company would use / upload this sample data within the solution you showed in your virtual demonstration
Once you’ve had a chance to ingest and ‘test drive’ the sample data, CFIC would host a follow-on demo and Q&A meeting (on or around 07 JAN)
The Stakeholders and Assessors would want to see the sample data in use in your solution platform
You would respond to Q&A regarding your solution’s functionality & results of specific data queries using the sample data in your solution

Please let me know if you would agree to participate so we can map out this process more thoroughly for you with dates, times, and calendar invitations.

@Tilmann what's your thoughts on this?
