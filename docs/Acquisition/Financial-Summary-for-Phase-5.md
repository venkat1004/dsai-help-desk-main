## Key Financial Facts

### Phase 2 (CIC #5 Challenge) - Completed
- **Total Prize Pool:** $1,000,000
- **Highest Single Award:** $175,000 (1st Place, Modeling & Predictive Analytics)
- **Purpose:** Concept validation and talent identification
- **Strategic Value:** Direct access to Phase 3 downselect and Phase 4 demo opportunity

### Phase 3 (Review & Downselect) - Completed
- **Evaluation:** White paper assessment by DoD evaluation team
- **Outcome:** Selection for Phase 4 virtual demonstrations

### Phase 4 (Virtual Demonstrations) - Completed
- **Format:** 1-hour live demo via MS Teams
- **Evaluation:** Same 6 criteria as white paper (reinforcement/clarification)
- **Outcome:** Advancement to Phase 5 (you are here)

### Phase 5 (Selection, Award, Execution) - PENDING

**Strative AI Help Desk Prototype OTA Award:**
- **Target Contract Value:** ~$471,000
- **Scope:** AI-Enabled Help Desk for PCTE (not PCTE-in-a-Box)
- **Approval authority:** Commanding Officer / Director / Senior Procurement Executive

**Prototype Duration:**
- Expected: 6-12 months
- Milestone-based payment structure

**Payment Structure:**
- Milestone-based (not T&M)
- Two types:
  1. Fixed Milestone Payments (predetermined amounts upon milestone achievement)
  2. Expenditure-Based Milestone Payments (milestone value as maximum, adjusted based on actual expenditures)
- Certificate of Completion required for each milestone to trigger payment

### Follow-On Production (Post-Phase 5)

**Statutory Authority:** 10 U.S.C. §4022(f)

**Strative AI Help Desk Follow-On Opportunity:**
- Successful prototype completion may lead to production OTA
- **Contingent on:** Successful prototype completion + availability of funds + PCTE stakeholder satisfaction
- **NOT guaranteed** but possible pathway for continued engagement

**Key Requirement:** Initial OTA solicitation should include provisions for follow-on production contract

## Strategic Implications for Strative AI

### 1. Phase 5 Award: AI Help Desk Prototype OTA (~$471K)

**Target Contract Value:** ~$471,000  
**Scope:** AI-Enabled Help Desk for PCTE (not PCTE-in-a-Box)  
**Duration:** 6-12 months  
**Payment:** Milestone-based, requiring rigorous tracking

### 2. Prototype OTA is the Immediate Opportunity

**Phase 5 Award Structure:**
- Prototype OTA value: ~$471,000
- Duration: 6-12 months
- Payment: Milestone-based
- Approval: Commanding Officer / Director / Senior Procurement Executive

### 3. Follow-On Production is Possible

**Potential Follow-On Opportunity:**
- Successful prototype completion may lead to production OTA
- Value: TBD based on PCTE stakeholder requirements
- Timeline: Post-prototype completion
- Contingent on: Successful execution + fund availability

### 4. Milestone-Based Payments Require Operational Excellence

**Critical success factor:**
- Precise milestone definition in OTA
- Rigorous internal cost tracking (even though OTA is non-FAR)
- Timely Certificate of Completion submission
- Potential for milestone adjustment based on expenditure tracking

## Financial Landscape Context

### DoD Prototype OTA Market
- **FY2024 Total Obligations:** $16+ Billion
- **Acquisition Vehicle:** 10 U.S.C. §4022 (OTA authority)
- **Exemption:** Most FAR statutes (but not fiscal law)
- **Flexibility:** Customizable terms and conditions to attract non-traditional contractors

### PCTE Program Context
- **Acquisition Lead:** PEO STRI
- **Strategic Priority:** Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture (JCWA) element
- **AI Help Desk Prototype Award:** ~$471,000
- **Scope:** AI-Enabled Help Desk for PCTE (not PCTE-in-a-Box)

### CIC #5 to AI Help Desk Prototype Pathway
- **Challenge Prize Pool:** $1 Million (minimal)
- **Prototype OTA Pathway:** Direct access to PEO STRI rapid prototyping
- **AI Help Desk Award:** ~$471,000 prototype OTA
- **Timeline:** Phase 5 award expected in 2QFY26 (April-June 2026)

## Recommended Phase 5 Negotiation Talking Points

### 1. Contract Value & Structure
- **Ask:** What is the anticipated prototype OTA value range?
- **Rationale:** Align resource planning with funding level
- **Positioning:** Emphasize technical depth and integration complexity warrant appropriate funding

### 2. Milestone Definition
- **Ask:** Will CFIC provide sample milestone structure or template?
- **Rationale:** Ensure clarity and achievability
- **Positioning:** Propose aggressive but realistic milestones aligned with PEO STRI's 6-month rapid prototyping model

### 3. Follow-On Production Pathway
- **Ask:** Will the prototype OTA explicitly include provisions for non-competitive follow-on production?
- **Rationale:** Statutory requirement under 10 U.S.C. §4022(f)
- **Positioning:** Emphasize commitment to PCTE integration and long-term partnership

### 4. Payment Terms & Schedule
- **Ask:** Fixed milestone or expenditure-based milestone payments?
- **Rationale:** Plan cash flow and financial management
- **Positioning:** Demonstrate capability to track and manage milestone-based payments rigorously

### 5. Integration & DevSecOps Support
- **Ask:** What level of PCTE DevSecOps support will be provided?
- **Rationale:** Understand integration resource requirements
- **Positioning:** Emphasize readiness to integrate with PCTE enterprise architecture

## Action Items for Phase 5 Success

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Contact CFIC to request Phase 5 timeline and clarification on financial structure
2. Prepare list of specific financial questions for CFIC discussion
3. Review OTA statutory requirements (10 U.S.C. §4022)

### Short-Term (2-3 Weeks)
1. Prepare financial projections for potential prototype OTA scenarios ($2.5M, $5M, $10M)
2. Develop milestone structure proposal aligned with technical roadmap
3. Prepare follow-on production strategy document

### Medium-Term (3-4 Weeks)
1. Finalize Phase 5 presentation with financial readiness section
2. Prepare negotiation strategy for contract terms
3. Develop resource allocation plan for multi-year engagement
