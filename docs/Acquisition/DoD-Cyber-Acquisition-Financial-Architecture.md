# Financial Architecture and Acquisition Pathways in DoD Cyber Prototyping

## I. Executive Synthesis: The Dual-Track Funding Model for Cyber Prototypes

The Department of Defense (DoD) cyber acquisition landscape operates on a sophisticated, dual-track financial model designed to balance high-speed innovation identification with large-scale, enterprise-level fielding. The foundational strategy involves utilizing low-value, high-visibility challenges—such as the Cyber Innovation Challenge (CIC)—as rapid concept vetting and talent identification mechanisms. These challenges serve as the initial gateway (Phase 1) to significantly higher-value, rapid prototyping agreements (Phase 2) structured primarily through Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) under 10 U.S.C. §4022 (formerly §2371b).

This strategic approach compresses the acquisition cycle, prioritizing the rapid fielding of capabilities required by entities like US Cyber Command (USCC). The financial disparity between these two phases is stark: initial awards, such as those within CIC #5, offer immediate prizes, with the highest single award reaching $175,000.^1^ In contrast, successful transition leads to Prototype OTAs that typically range up to $100 Million, with required approval thresholds extending to awards exceeding $500 Million.^2^ Ultimately, these prototypes mature into follow-on production contracts or transactions that can command value estimates reaching into the billions, as exemplified by the estimated **$3.7 Billion** value associated with the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE)-in-a-Box initiative.^4^

The organizational structure of this funding mechanism reveals a critical purpose. The minimal financial prize pool allocated to the CIC ($1 million total) ^1^ is insufficient to fund complex development programs; consequently, the primary value of the challenge is the direct, non-competitive access it provides to the massive follow-on production opportunities. The explicit linkage of CIC #5 to PEO STRI, the Army Cyber Technology and Innovation Center (ArCTIC), and USCYBERCOM’s requirements for the PCTE program ^4^ confirms that the challenge functions as a strategic, low-cost "Assessment Event" ^6^ for high-risk/high-reward acquisition. This process bypasses traditional, protracted source selection methods, aligning funding mechanisms with the high pace of cyber operations. The scale of this non-FAR-based acquisition model is substantial, with DoD prototype OTA obligations exceeding $16 billion in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 alone.^7^

## II. The DoD Cyber Innovation Challenge (CIC) Model: Structure and Initial Awards

The Cyber Innovation Challenge (CIC) series is an active mechanism used by the DoD to rapidly acquire cutting-edge cyber solutions. CIC #5, in particular, is positioned as a critical feeder for one of the military’s most important cyber readiness programs.

### A. CIC #5: Objectives, Problem Areas, and Immediate Award Values

CIC #5 is a collaborative effort involving the Cyber Fusion Innovation Center (CFIC) and ArCTIC, executed under the management of the Program Executive Office - Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI).^5^ The stated objective is to identify individuals or teams capable of developing sophisticated solutions to address critical cyber threats.^1^

The challenge is structured with a total award pool of $1 million, distributed among top performers across three distinct, highly specific technical areas ^1^:

1. **Modeling and Predictive Analytics:** Total funding allocated is $350,000, with the 1st Place award reaching $175,000.^1^
2. **Persona and Influence:** Total funding allocated is $325,000, with $150,000 for 1st Place.^1^
3. **Data and Permeability:** Total funding allocated is $325,000.^1^

The distribution of this limited funding pool across multiple problem areas demonstrates the challenge’s purpose: to procure validated concepts and identify technical talent, rather than fund the full-scale development phase.

| **Problem Area**            | **Total Funding Allocation**            | **1st Place Award**            | **2nd Place Award**  | **3rd Place Award**  | **Source** |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Modeling and Predictive Analytics | $350,000                           | $175,000 | $100,000                   | $75,000 | ^1^                        |                            |                  |

| Data and Permeability             | $325,000                                      | N/A (Implied Top 3 Awards)           | N/A (Implied Top 3 Awards) | N/A (Implied Top 3 Awards) | ^1^              |
| **Overall Challenge Total** | **$1,000,000**                          |                                      |                            |                            |                  |

### B. Connecting the Challenge to Major Acquisition Programs

The true financial significance of CIC #5 is its explicit branding as the "Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) - Cyber Innovation Challenge (CIC) 5".^5^ The challenge is designed to "enhance and address PCTE training platform needs" ^4^, focusing on closing capability gaps identified by USCYBERCOM and the program office.^4^

The timeline projects the assessment event to commence in 4QFY25, culminating in an estimated award in 2QFY26.^6^ Crucially, the outcome is framed as a "Potential follow-on production OTA for future capability releases".^6^ This direct pipeline confirms that the challenge is not an end in itself, but a mechanism to feed validated technologies and teams into the long-term, high-value PCTE acquisition program.

### C. Contextualizing CIC Awards

While specific contract values for past CIC winners transitioned to OTAs are often non-public, parallel competitions confirm the model’s intent. For instance, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) offered a larger prize pool, totaling $8.5 million with a $4 million grand prize.^8^ The goal of the AIxCC was to rapidly source open-source AI models for critical infrastructure defense.^9^ This model underscores that for specialized, emerging technologies, the DoD relies on publicized challenges to rapidly identify and mature open-source or non-traditional solutions, with the substantive financial engagement deferred until the prototyping phase via an OTA.

## III. Prototype Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs): Statutory and Financial Framework

Prototype Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) are the primary instrument for funding and executing the development phase following initial concept validation. OTAs provide the necessary financial and contractual agility for cyber initiatives.

### A. Legal Authority and Contractual Flexibility

Prototype OTAs operate under the legal authority of 10 U.S.C. §4022 (formerly 10 U.S.C. §2371b).^3^ This authority permits the DoD to enter into agreements for prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of DoD personnel or improving platforms, systems, or materials.^10^

OTAs are distinct from traditional procurement contracts because they are exempt from most Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) statutes.^7^ This exemption allows contracting officials to customize terms and conditions, a flexibility intended to attract non-traditional defense contractors (NDCs) who might otherwise avoid the complexity of the standard FAR environment.^3^ However, this flexibility does not exempt the agreements from fiscal law requirements, meaning the choice of an OTA instrument does not expand or restrict available funding types, which for prototyping efforts generally must be Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations.^11^

### B. Typical Prototype Contract Values and Duration

The financial scope of prototype OTAs is vast, confirming their role as a primary funding vehicle for DoD modernization. DoD prototype OTA obligations exceeded $16 billion in FY2024.^7^ The approval hierarchy dictates the value ceiling for individual transactions:

1. **Up to $100 Million:** Authority typically rests with Commanding Officers, Directors, or Senior Procurement Executives.^2^
2. **$100 Million to $500 Million:** Approval is elevated to the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) or Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)).^2^
3. **Over $500 Million:** Requires the highest level of approval from the USD(R&E) or USD(A&S).^2^

Table 2: Prototype and Production Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) Value Limits

| **Transaction Value**  | **Required Approval Authority**                        | **Reference Source** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Up to $100 Million           | Commanding Officer / Director / Senior Procurement Executive | ^2^                        |
| $100 Million to $500 Million | USD (R&E) or USD (A&S)                                       | ^2^                        |
| Over $500 Million            | USD (R&E) or USD (A&S)*                                      | ^2^                        |

Contract duration for prototype OTAs is negotiable.^3^ PEO STRI’s planned efforts for specific AI/Data OTAs illustrate the rapid nature of cyber prototyping, citing prototyping phases that begin in 4QFY25 and last for just 6 months, with estimated values between $2.5 million and $3 million.^6^ Conversely, complex prototyping programs can utilize a significantly longer Period of Performance, such as the I-STAR Program example, which was structured across 36 months.^10^

### C. Detailed Payment Structures: Focus on Milestones

The payment structure for prototype OTAs is fundamentally driven by performance milestones rather than traditional Time and Materials (T&M) or purely lump sum models, though fixed-price arrangements are common. The core structure involves a Schedule of Payments and Milestones.^10^

The common milestone payment arrangements are divided into two types ^10^:

1. **Fixed Milestone Payments:** These are predetermined, fixed amounts paid upon the achievement of a defined technical milestone. The payment amount is not adjusted based on cost accrual, provided the project’s technical scope remains unchanged.^10^
2. **Expenditure-Based Milestone Payments:** This structure uses the milestone value to define the maximum potential payment. The payment is contingent upon milestone achievement but allows for the adjustment of future milestones based on the awardee’s actual expenditures against the forecasted plan, typically reconciled annually.^10^

Although OTAs are intended to attract NDCs through flexible terms, the reliance on expenditure-based milestone payments implies that the government requires substantial visibility into the contractor’s financial performance. To justify potential adjustments or negotiate the next tranche of funding, even non-FAR contractors must maintain rigorous internal financial tracking processes equivalent to those necessary to satisfy cost performance scrutiny. This requirement inherently mitigates some of the oversight risk noted by bodies like the Government Accountability Office (GAO).^7^ A Certificate of Completion must be signed and submitted by the performer for each completed milestone to facilitate payment.^12^

## IV. Transition to Production: Follow-on Contract Mechanisms

The transition from a successful prototype to full production represents the highest financial reward and is governed by specific statutory conditions that bypass standard competitive procedures.

### A. Statutory Requirements for Non-Competitive Follow-on Awards

The statutory authority allowing for non-competitive follow-on production rests upon 10 U.S.C. §4022(f) (formerly 2371b(f)).^13^ This authority permits the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction if it is determined that the competitively awarded prototype project was successfully completed.^15^

Two critical legal provisions must be met to utilize this authority:

1. The initial OTA solicitation and agreement must explicitly include provisions for a follow-on production contract.^13^ This ensures that all potential competitors are aware of the production path from the outset.
2. The resulting follow-on award is contingent upon the availability of funds.^15^

The ability to proceed to production "without the use of competitive procedures" is the primary financial incentive driving industry investment and participation in the prototype phase.^15^ This represents a significant advantage over traditional acquisition pathways.

### B. Guaranteed vs. Potential Follow-on Funding

Despite the powerful incentive of non-competitive transition, successful prototype completion does not constitute a guarantee of follow-on funding. The production award remains conditional, dependent first on the successful completion of the prototype and second on the availability of appropriated funds.^15^

### C. Typical Production Contract Values and Duration Post-Prototype

Follow-on production phases represent a massive scaling of financial commitment. These contracts can run to "hundreds of millions of dollars".^17^ At the enterprise level, production OTAs frequently utilize the elevated approval tiers, falling into the $100 million to over $500 million categories.^2^

In FY2024, DoD systematically tracked approximately $2.45 billion in total production OTA obligations.^18^ Large-scale, cyber-related integration efforts validate the high ceiling of these awards, such as a major $928 Million Prototype Engineering and Mission Integration contract awarded to a contractor.^19^ The most salient example in the context of USCC cyber acquisition is the "PCTE-in-a-Box" requirement, which is planned with an estimated program value of  **$3.7 Billion** .^4^ This five-year structure, consisting of a 1-year base period and four 1-year options ^4^, clearly positions the program for long-term, sustained integration and capability release.

The choice of transition vehicle post-prototype is strategic. Although GAO analysis shows that some weapon systems revert to standard FAR contracts for production to gain greater insight into contractor costs and mitigate financial risk ^7^, the PEO STRI/PCTE documentation explicitly seeks a "Potential follow-on production OTA" for future capability releases.^6^ This determination underscores the critical importance of maintaining agility for rapidly evolving cyber capabilities used by USCYBERCOM, where the ability to quickly modify and deploy new functions outweighs the standard DoD preference for strict cost oversight during the production phase.

## V. Case Study: USCC, PEO STRI, and the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE)

The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) program provides a definitive illustration of how US Cyber Command leverages OTAs and innovation challenges to fund and acquire mission-critical capabilities.

### A. PEO STRI Acquisition Methodology: Rapid Prototyping

PEO STRI is designated as the DoD Acquisition Lead for PCTE ^20^, a platform enabling standardized training, team certification, and mission rehearsal for the Joint Cyberspace Operations Forces.^21^ To execute this mission, PEO STRI utilizes specialized organizational structures, such as the STRI Agile Acquisition Response (STAAR) Directorate. STAAR functions as the Technology Center of Excellence, focused specifically on leading "rapid prototyping and testing" and ensuring capabilities are delivered "at the speed of relevance".^22^

This institutionalized rapid prototyping methodology explains the aggressive durations noted in PEO STRI’s planning, where specific AI and data-focused prototype OTAs are planned for just 6 months, demonstrating an intent to quickly move from concept validation to program transition.^6^

### B. PCTE Program Financial Profile and Budget Justification

PCTE is identified as one of the five elements of the Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture (JCWA), confirming its status as a foundational, mission-critical program for USCYBERCOM.^20^ The program's budget justification reflects its high priority, particularly within the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding stream:

The RDT&E funding trajectory shows a significant commitment to development:

* FY 2024 Total RDT&E: $114.980 Million.^20^
* FY 2025 Base Projection RDT&E: $158.345 Million.^20^

Table 3: Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) RDT&E Budget Profile

| **Program Element**                         | **FY 2024 Total ($M)** | **FY 2025 Base Projection ($M)** | **Acquisition Lead** | **Overall Program Scope Reference** | **Source**                             |     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --- |
| PE 0208086JCY / Cyber Training Environment (CY01) | 114.980                                                           | 158.345                    | PEO STRI                                  | $3.7 Billion (5-Year PCTE-in-a-Box Estimate) | ^4^ |

The ultimate financial scale of the program, particularly the "PCTE-in-a-Box" concept linked directly to CIC #5, is estimated at $3.7 Billion over five years.^4^ This five-year structure, utilizing options years typical of major acquisition contracts, demonstrates a multi-billion-dollar commitment to enterprise integration and sustainment derived from successful prototypes.

### C. Integration of CIC #5 Outputs into PCTE

The Cyber Innovation Challenge serves a defined role in closing PCTE’s capability gaps. The challenge’s focus areas (Modeling, Persona, Data) ^1^ align precisely with capability gaps under assessment by USCYBERCOM.^4^ The operational strategy involves leveraging the rapid prototyping OTAs (6-month durations) ^6^ to quickly mature the most promising CIC solutions for subsequent integration into the massive, $3.7 billion enterprise contract.^4^ This sequence demonstrates a continuous process where innovation is sourced rapidly, prototyped quickly, and transitioned without friction into a high-value, long-term program of record.

## VI. Cyber Fusion Innovation Center (CFIC) Funded Initiatives

The Cyber Fusion Innovation Center (CFIC) plays a crucial intermediary role in facilitating technology development and transition, distinct from the specific prototype contracts themselves.

### A. Role and Aggregate Funding Scale of CFIC

CFIC and its parent organization, the Cyber Innovation Center (CIC), function as significant conduits for federal investment into cyber infrastructure and workforce development. The Cyber Innovation Center secured a major federal funding award totaling $129 Million.^24^

This substantial funding is utilized not for specific product prototypes, but for ecosystem building. For example, $95.6 million of this funding was secured through a Partnership Intermediary Agreement (PIA) with Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) to support the STRIKEWERX innovation hub and general technology transfer efforts.^25^ The remaining funds are used for initiatives like expanding the CYBER.org education network.^25^

The analysis differentiates between these high-level, aggregate infrastructure awards and project-specific prototype OTAs. The $129 million award is categorized as funding for the *infrastructure* (workforce, centers, partnerships) that feeds innovative ideas into the DoD’s acquisition pipeline, particularly through collaboration on initiatives like CIC #5.^5^

### B. CFIC’s Acquisition Strategy

CFIC is fully integrated into the DoD’s rapid acquisition strategy. Its materials explicitly confirm the understanding and planned utilization of 10 U.S.C. §4022 authority for follow-on awards.^15^ By executing prototype projects under this statute, CFIC ensures that successfully proven concepts can transition immediately into non-competitive production contracts or transactions, subject only to successful execution and fund availability.^15^ This confirms CFIC’s function as an acquisition accelerator, utilizing competition and partnership agreements to reduce risk before transitioning technology into the highest tiers of DoD procurement.

## VII. Strategic Recommendations for Contractors

Based on the analysis of financial structures, statutory pathways, and programmatic intent, several key strategic recommendations emerge for entities seeking to engage in DoD cyber acquisition, particularly within the USCC/PEO STRI ecosystem.

### A. Optimizing Financial Planning for Milestone-Based Payments

Contractors must recognize that the agility of OTAs is offset by the rigor required in defining and executing milestone payments. Proposals for Prototype OTAs must define performance milestones with exceptional technical clarity, as the successful execution and certification of these milestones are prerequisites for payment.^12^ Ambiguity in milestone definition will invariably lead to financial delays and contract administration challenges. Furthermore, when negotiating expenditure-based milestone payments, contractors are required to manage and track internal expenditures rigorously. Although OTAs are exempt from standard FAR cost principles, sophisticated cost visibility is necessary to justify cost accruals and substantiate adjustments to future milestones, particularly when dealing with large, multi-year programs.^10^

### B. Strategic Positioning for Non-Competitive Follow-on

The highest value in the DoD cyber acquisition process resides not in the initial CIC prize money or even the prototype OTA itself, but in the access to non-competitive follow-on production awards. Companies must view the prototype phase as an intense, high-stakes competitive down-selection that grants exclusivity to billion-dollar opportunities. Therefore, ensuring that the initial OTA documentation explicitly includes the mandatory provisions for a follow-on production contract is a critical contractual prerequisite for accessing those $500 Million and higher contracts.^2^

### C. Understanding the Appropriations Context

Contractors engaging in prototyping must maintain an understanding of the underlying fiscal framework. Prototype efforts are generally funded by RDT&E appropriations.^11^ The projected acceleration of PCTE RDT&E funding (from $114.980M in FY24 to $158.345M in FY25) ^20^ indicates a favorable financial environment for new technology injection. Aligning proposal development and technology readiness levels with these known budget cycles is essential for securing appropriate, timely funding.

## VIII. Conclusions

The financial architecture of DoD cyber acquisition is deliberately constructed to prioritize speed and agility, serving the critical need of USCYBERCOM to maintain technological superiority. The process is characterized by a definitive funding funnel:

1. **Low-Cost Vetting:** Small, competitive awards (CIC #5, up to $175,000) are utilized to validate concepts and identify innovative teams.^1^
2. **Accelerated Development:** Successful concepts transition to Prototype OTAs (up to $100M, and potentially higher) characterized by short performance periods (as short as 6 months for PEO STRI efforts) ^6^, and milestone-based payments designed to enforce performance over effort.^10^
3. **High-Value Transition:** The ultimate reward is the non-competitive transition to production under 10 U.S.C. §4022(f), leading to contracts or transactions valued in the hundreds of millions, and in the case of PCTE, program estimates reaching $3.7 Billion.^4^

This system effectively institutionalizes the "speed of relevance," transforming the acquisition process into a rapid cycle of innovation sourcing, focused prototyping, and enterprise fielding. For contractors, success is contingent upon technical performance, precise compliance with milestone-based payment requirements, and a strategic focus on obtaining the statutory access to the massive follow-on production market.
